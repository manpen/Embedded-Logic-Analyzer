There are two versions of this project:

1) Single File version
  This version combines all entities and packages
  in one file and makes them available in the common
  library EMBEDDED_LA. To use it just import the file
  unify/embedded_la.vhd into your project and adopt the
  configuration in the head of the file.

2) Development version with one file per entity
  This version is used for development but its quite
  tedious to embedded it into other project as it contains
  about 40 files and 3 vhdl libraries.
