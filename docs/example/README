This is a very easy example to demonstrate how
to embedded the logic analyzer into an existing
desing.

The host design is a 26 bit counter. The analyzer
is hooked up to the lower bits of the counter's
vector. The .ucf file can be used for a 
 DIGILENT Spartan 3 Evalutaion Board

 To synthesize the design just include soc.vhd,
 soc.ucf and /hardware/unify/embedded_la.vhd.
