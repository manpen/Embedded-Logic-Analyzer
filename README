This project is under development and not intended
for public use. While the hardware should work quite
well with the Xilinx Toolchain (tested with Spartan 3
and Virtex 4), the software client is rarely tested.

There is no explicit english documentation yet, but each
vhd-file contains a brief introduction, and the c++ codes
include doxygen annotations. Additionally in the doc-folder
there's an example showing how-to embed the core.
